========

Kurippu - is a command line interface for Evernote,
It allows you to:

   * find notes in your Evernote;
   * remove notes in your Evernote;
 

   
Kurippu has been written on Python, 

### The Problem Given By RajaRavivarma

1 Goto this website:
    https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli
2. Develop a similar command line interface using Python/Ruby and Evernote API (http://dev.evernote.com/doc/).
    We prefer it in Python/Ruby but any language can be used.

3. We expect these functionalities:
    1. Showing a list of created Notes.
    2. Saving a Note to Evernote along with a title.
    3. Deleting a Note, from the list.
    4. Adding tags to a Note (Optional)
    All of these pertain to Evernote API.

You may submit it on Tuesday. (24-Dec-2013) if you use Python/Ruby or a day before if you are using a well known language.
